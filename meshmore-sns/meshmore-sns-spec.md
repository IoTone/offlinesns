## Problem

While Meshcore protocol is open source, the client is not open source.  We want ta general purpose Meshcore compatible client available under a friendly academic open source license.
 

## Requirements

- R1: app is written in flutter
- R2: app runs on Android and iOS
- R3: app uses bluetooth to communicate with a Meshcore client device. 
- R4: app is localized to English and Japanese
- R5: app can perform TTS using the GPU on the phone and should have a TTS mode that can be turned on, off by default
- R6: app should support a small scrollable, collapsable chat interface that is using the active channel, and has an easy way to switch channels 
- R7: app should be able to configure all Meshcore settings, and input radio settings if defaults are not available
- R8: app has a dashboard as the default home screen
- R9: app has an about screen with the app information
- R10: app has a Terms and Condition
- R11: app has a swipe gesture to left or right to navigate to diferent views, and a long press on the icon to get a navigation menu. 

## Meshcore Protocol Implementation Plan

This section is the agreed plan for implementing the Meshcore companion
protocol in Dart and proving conformance (satisfies R3 and the TC1–TC4
test cases).

### Scope and source of truth

- The client talks to a Meshcore radio using the **companion-radio
  protocol** (the frame protocol a phone/app uses to drive a Meshcore
  device). This is distinct from the over-the-air LoRa mesh packet format;
  we implement the companion side only.
- **Authoritative source:** the MeshCore firmware repository
  (`https://github.com/meshcore-dev/MeshCore`). We **pin a specific
  firmware commit** and transcribe all opcodes, frame layouts, struct
  field orders, and crypto parameters from that commit. The pinned commit
  is recorded in the protocol package (`lib/src/codec/constants.dart`
  header + README) and **asserted by a test**; it is bumped deliberately,
  never silently.
- **Current pin:** tag `companion-v1.15.0`, commit
  `dee3e26ac081a5c668c69b66c16a6544a44ddc5b`.
- **Source precedence (learned in M1):** the markdown spec
  `docs/companion_protocol.md` is **incomplete** — it documents framing,
  UUIDs, APP_START, SELF_INFO, and OK/ERROR, but **omits field layouts
  for contacts/time and several commands entirely** (`GET_CONTACTS`,
  `GET_DEVICE_TIME`, `SET_DEVICE_TIME` appear only in source). The
  firmware **source is authoritative** where the two differ or the doc is
  silent. The companion frame (de)serialization lives in
  `examples/companion_radio/MyMesh.cpp` (command dispatch + `out_frame`
  writes) — transcribe byte layouts from there, at the pinned commit.
- `tools/liboffsns/` is a separate **Meshtastic** PoC and is **not** reused
  here — Meshcore is a different protocol.

### Packaging and architecture

The protocol is a **standalone, pure-Dart package** with zero Flutter
dependencies, so conformance tests run under `dart test` in CI without a
device or emulator. It lives at the **submodule root**, a sibling of the
Flutter app, so the app's path dependency (`meshcore: { path:
../packages/meshcore }`) stays self-contained on the `meshmore-sns`
submodule branch.

```
packages/meshcore/                 # pure-Dart, no Flutter imports
  lib/
    meshcore.dart                  # public API barrel

      transport/
        transport.dart             # [M0] abstract MeshcoreTransport — NO BLE here

    constants_test.dart            # [M0] pin + opcode + framing assertions
    frame_codec_test.dart          # [M1] vector goldens + programmatic + totality
    vectors/m1_frames.json         # [M1] conformance vectors (hex ⇄ decoded)
    # later: crypto/ KATs, more vectors/*.json
meshmore_sns_app/ (Flutter, ./responsive_starter_app)
  lib/transport/ble_meshcore_transport.dart   # [M5] MeshcoreTransport via flutter_blue_plus + the BLE service
  lib/services/…                              # [M5+] wires transport → codec/session → app state (Provider)
```

A core discipline established in M1: **`decode()` is total** — malformed
or truncated input yields a `DecodeFailure` value and unknown opcodes an
`UnsupportedFrame` (raw bytes preserved); the decoder never throws to
callers. This is what the negative/fuzz conformance tests enforce.

Layering (each layer testable in isolation):

1. **Transport** — abstract `MeshcoreTransport`: opens a bidirectional byte
   stream. BLE implementation lives in the app (R3); the package stays
   pure-Dart and is fed bytes by tests.
2. **Framing** — split the raw byte stream into protocol frames; handle
   BLE-MTU fragmentation/reassembly.
3. **Codec** — encode app→device command frames; decode device→app
   response and async push frames into typed events; typed decode errors
   (never throws on malformed input).
4. **Session** — request/response correlation, the contact-sync state
   machine, outbound message queue/ack tracking, device time sync.
5. **Crypto** — split by capability across two pure-Dart libraries
   (neither covers both needs; finalized in M2/M3b):
   - **`package:pointycastle`** — *symmetric*: raw **AES-128-ECB**
     (MeshCore's channel/DM cipher; `package:cryptography` omits ECB),
     HMAC-SHA256, SHA-256/512.
   - **`package:cryptography`** — *asymmetric*: Ed25519 verify and
     X25519 ECDH (pure-Dart `DartEd25519`/`DartX25519`; pointycastle
     3.9.x ships neither). This re-vindicates the original
     `package:cryptography` selection for the asymmetric layer.
   The Ed25519→Montgomery-u birational map (the one piece neither
   library exposes) is a small in-package BigInt routine. All anchored
   by RFC 8032/7748 + offline **libsodium**-generated KATs.
6. **Domain/state** — app-facing repository of contacts, channels,
   messages, and node/link status.

### Initial real-hardware test configuration

On-device milestones (M5/M6) and TC1/TC3/TC4 are validated against this
reference setup:

- **App host:** a Flutter **Android** device (Android is the primary
  on-device test target; iOS validated subsequently).
- **Radio hardware:** **Seeed Studio T1000-E** tracker devices flashed
  with MeshCore firmware via the official flasher
  (`https://meshcore.co.uk/flasher.html`).
- **Topology:** at least two T1000-E nodes so messages traverse the mesh
  rather than a single device loopback. Where a relay is needed to
  exercise multi-hop, one node is configured per the **Repeater** guidance
  in the MeshCore wiki
  (`https://meshcore.co.uk/wiki.html#124-repeater`); this also documents
  the role/region/radio settings used to seed the app's defaults (R7) and
  the conformance interop fixtures.
- **Link under test:** the Android app connects to one T1000-E over the
  BLE companion transport (R3); the second node (and any repeater) closes
  the loop for send/receive and encrypted/unencrypted checks.

The firmware version flashed onto the T1000-E units is recorded alongside
the pinned firmware commit (see *Scope and source of truth*) so the
on-device behaviour and the offline conformance vectors stay aligned.

### Conformance test strategy (TC2)

"Passes all conformance tests" is defined as the union of:

- **Vector goldens** — `test/vectors/*.json`. Two directions:
  *encode* cases assert the encoder produces a **byte-exact** frame
  (anchored where possible to verbatim examples in the pinned doc, e.g.
  the APP_START `mccli` example); *decode* cases assert a hex frame
  decodes to the expected typed model. Large/variable frames
  (SELF_INFO, CONTACT) are additionally exercised by programmatic
  goldens that build the bytes from the documented layout and assert
  every field plus the fixed frame length, so layout drift is caught.
- **Crypto KATs** — fixed known-answer tests for Ed25519 sign/verify,
  X25519 shared-secret derivation, and AES, with vectors taken from the
  firmware and/or the relevant RFCs, so our crypto matches the device
  byte-for-byte.
- **Negative/fuzz tests** — truncated, over-length, and garbage frames
  must yield typed errors and never crash or hang the decoder.
- **Interop fixtures** — optional captured real-device frames (BLE sniff
  or wired serial dump) checked in under `test/vectors/` as regression
  anchors against the pinned firmware.
- **CI gate** — `dart test` for `packages/meshcore` runs on every change;
  the conformance suite is the merge gate. On-device integration tests are
  separate and run behind a flag.

### Progress log

- **M0** (submodule commit `488b776`): pure-Dart package scaffolded at
  `packages/meshcore`, sibling to the app; firmware pinned
  (`companion-v1.15.0` / `dee3e26`) and asserted by test; `constants.dart`
  seeded with BLE UUIDs, framing rules, core opcodes, SNR conversion;
  abstract `MeshcoreTransport`; CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) running
  the conformance gate + app analyze/test.
- **M1** (submodule commit `69acc47`): byte layouts transcribed from
  `MyMesh.cpp` at the pin (doc was partial — see *Source precedence*);
  `ByteCursor`/`FrameBuilder`; encoders (`appStart`, `getContacts`,
  `getDeviceTime`, `setDeviceTime`, `syncNextMessage`); **total**
  `decode()` → sealed `MeshcoreInbound` (OK, ERROR, CONTACTS_START,
  CONTACT 148B, END_OF_CONTACTS, SELF_INFO, CURR_TIME, NO_MORE_MESSAGES,
  UnsupportedFrame, DecodeFailure); `SelfInfo`/`Contact` models;
  conformance suite **28 tests green** (`vectors/m1_frames.json` +
  programmatic SELF_INFO/CONTACT goldens + totality tests).

- **M2** (submodule commit _pending_): channel frame layouts from
  `MyMesh.cpp`; encoders `sendChannelTextMessage` / `getChannel` /
  `setChannel`; decoders MSG_SENT (0x06), CHANNEL_MSG_RECV (0x08) +
  V3 (0x11), CHANNEL_INFO (0x12); models `ChannelMessage` /
  `ChannelInfo` / `MsgSent`. `MeshcoreChannelCrypto` ports
  `Utils::encrypt/decrypt/encryptThenMAC/MACThenDecrypt` + channel
  hash (AES-128-ECB zero-pad; HMAC-SHA256→2B over the 32-byte secret;
  `SHA256(secret)[0]`). Crypto-lib decision changed to **pointycastle**
  (see Crypto layer note + Risks). Conformance **57 tests green**
  (M2 vectors + programmatic + KATs anchored to NIST/RFC 4231).
  *Open item:* the public channel's name and the upper 16 bytes of a
  channel secret are not on the companion link — to be pinned by an
  M6 on-device interop fixture; `channelSecretFromPsk` zero-fills
  provisionally and no public-channel constants are fabricated.

- **M3a** (submodule commit _pending_): codec half of M3. Commands
  `sendTextMessage` (0x02), `sendSelfAdvert` (0x07), `setAdvertName`
  (0x08), `addUpdateContact` (0x09); decoders `CONTACT_MSG_RECV`
  (0x07) + V3 (0x10, signed `txt_type==2`), `ADVERTISEMENT` (0x80)
  with exact Ed25519 `signedMessage = pub_key ‖ ts ‖ app_data`;
  models `ContactMessage`/`Advert`; `Contact` stores raw lat/lon
  micros for byte-exact re-encode. **Public-channel constants now
  sourced** from `docs/qr_codes.md` (`Public` /
  `8b3387e9c5cdea6ac9e5edbaa115cd72`) — closes the M2 gap, no
  fabrication. Conformance **70 tests green**.
- **M3b** (submodule commit _pending_): crypto half — completes M3.
  `MeshcoreIdentityCrypto` (Ed25519 verify/verifyAdvert; pure-Dart
  `edPublicKeyToMontgomeryU`; `ed25519KeyExchange` =
  clamp(prv64[0:32]) · Montgomery-u via X25519, raw output;
  orlp-style `expandedPrivateKeyFromSeed`) and `MeshcoreDmCrypto`
  (ECDH secret + DM payload crypto delegating to the M2 routine — DM
  uses a full 32-byte secret, so **no tail ambiguity**). `cryptography`
  added for the asymmetric primitives. Anchored by RFC 8032 §7.1, RFC
  7748 §5.2, and **offline libsodium-generated** KATs
  (`vectors/m3b_x25519_kat.json`, via pynacl) covering the conversion,
  the full key exchange, and DH symmetry — our composition matches
  libsodium byte-for-byte. Conformance **81 tests green**.

### Open crypto items (to confirm via M6 on-device interop fixture)

1. **Channel secret tail** — `GroupChannel.secret[16..32]`. Strong
   evidence (qr_codes.md: ecosystem only ever shares 16 bytes;
   struct zero-init) ⇒ zeros; `channelSecretFromPsk` zero-fills.
   Confirm with the channel-hash / MAC oracle (`Public` PSK is known).
2. **`ed25519_key_exchange` exact bytes** — *largely closed in M3b*:
   anchored to RFC 8032/7748 **and** offline libsodium KATs (the
   conversion, full key-exchange, and DH symmetry all match libsodium
   byte-for-byte; output is raw/unhashed, matching orlp). Residual:
   confirm against a *real MeshCore device* DM exchange in M6 (low
   risk — libsodium is the reference implementation for this map).

Reverse-engineering path for both: source archaeology → reference-
client (meshcore.py / meshcore.js) differential → channel-hash air
oracle → MAC oracle on a T1000-E (M6). The known `Public` channel
PSK makes the channel-hash oracle a one-packet test.

Commit hashes refer to the `meshmore-sns` branch of the
`flutter-responsive-mobile-app-starter-iotj` submodule.

### Risks and mitigations

- **Protocol drift** — opcodes/structs change with firmware. *Mitigation:*
  pin a commit, transcribe constants in one place, bump deliberately,
  keep interop fixtures as regression anchors.
- **BLE MTU / fragmentation** — companion frames can exceed the BLE MTU.
  *Mitigation:* reassembly handled in the framing layer with explicit
  tests for split frames.
- **Crypto exactness** — KDF, nonce/IV construction, and AES mode must
  match the firmware precisely. *Mitigation:* KATs derived from firmware,
  not assumptions.
- **Device/version capability gating** — some features depend on device
  role or firmware version. *Mitigation:* capability/version negotiation
  from the self-info/version response before exercising optional commands.

## Future

- F1: Live map
 
## Test

Real-hardware test cases run against the reference setup in
*Meshcore Protocol Implementation Plan → Initial real-hardware test
configuration* (Flutter Android + Seeed T1000-E nodes on MeshCore).

- TC1: Connect to network — app establishes a BLE companion link to a
  Meshcore device and completes the app-start/self-info handshake. (M5/M6)
- TC2: Meshcore protocol parser passes all conformance tests — the full
  conformance suite (vector goldens + round-trip + crypto KATs +
  negative/fuzz + interop fixtures) is green and enforced as the merge
  gate. (M1–M4, finalized M7)
- TC3: Can send messages — channel and direct messages are sent and
  acknowledged against a real device. (M2/M3/M6)
- TC4: Can handle encrypted and unencrypted data — public/unencrypted and
  channel/DM-encrypted payloads round-trip correctly. (M2/M3/M4/M6)
- TBD
